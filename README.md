- Delete Tasks: Remove individual tasks from the list by clicking the delete button (✖) next to the task.

- Clear All Tasks: Clear all tasks at once with the "Clear All" button.

- Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser’s local storage, ensuring that they persist even after refreshing the page.

### Technologies Used
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
